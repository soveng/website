    title: 'Selection and Non-Discrimination Policy'
    content: |
      We accept participants based on merit, public proof-of-work, and their alignment with our [philosophy](/philosophy). We welcome anyone with an [npub](https://npub.world/) and relevant public commit history.

      We do not discriminate in our selection process based on race, ethnicity, creed, color, age, national origin, ancestry, religion, political opinion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, genetic information, veteran status, military status, or any other such status.

      This non-discrimination policy also applies to our organization internally, including officers, directors, board members, advisors, employees, and contractors.

    title: 'Partner and Personnel Review Policy'
    content: |
      All personnel and partnerships are evaluated based on their public record, professional conduct, and alignment with our commitment to open, merit-based collaboration and non-violent principles. We review our potential partners, employees, and contractors to ensure they do not support authoritarian or [partially-authoritarian](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/political-regime) regimes. Our efforts are focused on anti-authoritarian technology, i.e. systems that put the individual in charge as opposed to a third party. "Can't be evil" as opposed to "don't be evil."

    title: 'Non-Violence Commitment'

      Bitcoin is non-violent, and we are too. We are committed to peaceful, voluntary interactions and reject the use of force or coercion in all our activities. Our organization operates on principles of voluntary cooperation, mutual respect, and peaceful collaboration.
