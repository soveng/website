Title: Sovereign Engineering 
Slogan: "Ship the future"

Quote: “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.” —Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

Summary: Six weeks of high-bandwidth ideation, experimentation, mentorship, dialog, cross-pollination and discussions on how to build kickass applications, services, and businesses for a self-sovereign future. 

# What is Sovereign Engineering?



# How does it work? 
aka "How is the program structured?"
- 6 weeks 
- 21 participants 
- In-person, in Madeira 

Every week is structured the same. 
- Monday Mornings: Orientation
- Tuesday Talks: Participants are free to present whatever they find interesting/relevant
- Wednesday Workshops: Hands-on workshops
- Thursday: No Agenda
- Friday: Demo Day

The whole program revolves around "Demo Day" which is each Friday. Each Friday participants present a live demo of what they have been working on during the week. No slides, no presentations, no bullshit. In the best case demos are usable and deployed, but if something breaks or doesn't work just right it doesn't matter. What matters are the ideas. Showing off something bold, something new. Something fresh, something novel, something that wasn't possible before. A crazy idea, a silly experiment, some fancy applied cryptography, a new app, a new service, a prototype of something you always wanted to build. Vibe-coding encouraged.

# How can I join?
aka "What are the requirements?"

We assume that you know what Bitcoin is and why it is important. We assume that you know what Lightning is, how it works, and why instant settlement of a trustless digital bearer asset is a big deal. We assume that you know what nostr is and how it can help to un-silo the Web. We assume that you know how to code and that you have tinkered with things in the past.

We are looking for people with passion and an eagerness to build. Other than that, we don't have any requirements.

# Why Sovereign Engineering?

Sovereign Engineering exists because we want to see cool shit built. Not only built, but shipped, deployed, and actively being used. We believe that coming together in-person is crucial for the free flow and cross-pollination of ideas. While online communication and interaction is a great thing, there is no substitute for the high-bandwidth communication enabled by in-person collaboration.

We believe that the internet is fucked (Link to Calle's talk: https://youtu.be/OHqxp-Hrx9k) and that we can do better. We believe that Bitcoin and nostr have a crucial role to play in fixing the Web. We believe that the attention economy is a parasitic outgrowth (Link to Gigi's talk: https://njump.me/nevent1qqsqm2lz4ru6wlydzpulgs8m60ylp4vufwsg55whlqgua6a93vp2y4gpzamhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuer9wfnkjemf9e3k7mgzyphydppzm7m554ecwq4gsgaek2qk32atse2l4t9ks57dpms4mmhfxjc476g) of the legacy web, and we're convinced that there are better ways to interact and monetize. 


Guiding principle: what does it mean to build systems in the spirit of Bitcoin?
