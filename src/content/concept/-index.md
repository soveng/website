  content: |
      Sovereign Engineering is a six-week, in-person program on the island of Madeira. Its purpose is to create the best possible environment for **high-bandwidth ideation, collaboration, and rapid prototyping** around Freedom Tech such as Bitcoin, Lightning, and Nostr.

      The program runs on a relentless [weekly loop](/loop) designed for exploration: *Monday Mornings* set the theme for the week, *Tuesday Talks* provoke discussion, *Wednesday Workshops* transfer hands-on skills, *Thursday* offers time for reflection and experimentation, and by Friday's Demo Day every participant has completed an entire **show → talk → build** loop—ready to reset and do it again the following week.

      The program is **private and off the record**—a protected environment where value-aligned builders can think freely, experiment boldly, and ship rapidly without the constraints of too much public scrutiny. Bring 21 aligned people together in a place that is highly Bitcoin-friendly and beautiful, where a shift in perspective helps new ideas flourish—and remarkable things follow.

    title: 'Core Pillars'
    content: |
      Sovereign Engineering rests on five fundamental pillars that create the conditions for meaningful collaboration:

      **[The Weekly Loop](#weekly-loop)**: A steady show → talk → build rhythm that drives momentum and prevents perfectionism paralysis. Every week follows the same structure—a metronome for creativity.

      **[The Walks](#walks)**: Moderate hikes that stimulate creative thought through "left foot, right foot, left brain, right brain" activation. Walking isn't downtime—it's moving R&D.

      **[The Demo Days](#demo-day)**: Where the rubber meets the road—every participant demos working code every week. Aggressively time-boxed with 6-minute demos and 2-minute discussions.

      **[The Captains](#weekly-captains)**: Each week has a dedicated captain who steers the ship, ensuring organic emergence rather than top-down direction. Rotating leadership keeps the program tight without feeling top-down.

      **[The Environment](#environment)**: Madeira makes ideas tangible fast—Bitcoin-friendly merchants, high-bandwidth in-person time, and an off-the-record space for bold exploration. Privacy, presence, and immediacy compound.

      The week acts as a metronome for creativity. Friday's *Show* sets a hard deadline that concentrates effort—every participant demos something they wrote or prompted into existence themselves. The moment code compiles on stage it becomes shared reality. Over the weekend and during Monday's orientation the cohort *Talks*—walking Madeira's levadas, swapping critiques, and letting distributed cognition surface better approaches. From Tuesday onward everyone *Builds* toward the next demo.

    title: 'The Walks'
    content: |
      Walking isn't downtime—it's moving *R&D*. The weekend walks are a crucial component of Sovereign Engineering, designed for light-to-moderate two- to three-hour hikes at a comfortable pace where participants can walk side-by-side and have conversations without breaking a sweat.

      **Why Walking Works**: Research shows walking stimulates creative thought. As one participant put it: "left foot, right foot, left brain, right brain." The physical movement activates your whole being and creates the perfect conditions for free-flowing ideas.

      The island's levadas, coastal paths, and high-altitude ridges offer constantly changing scenery—nature's own slide deck. The sensory experience of sun, wind, and ocean spray anchors discussions in memory, making ideas easier to recall and reference later.

  - id: 'demo-day'
    title: 'The Demo Days'
    content: |
      Nothing concentrates the mind like a live demo. Every Friday afternoon the cohort gathers to **show whatever runs**. Polish is optional, honesty is mandatory. The rule is simple: you must demo something new every week—either related to ongoing work or completely fresh ideas.

      **Format**: Aggressively time-boxed with 6 minutes of demo time and 2 minutes of discussion. With 20+ demos, we take breaks after every 6-7 presentations, usually running three sessions. The day typically ends around 6 PM.

      **Philosophy**: We highly encourage trying bold ideas every week. It doesn't matter if it's half-broken or half-baked—just give it your best shot and show it on Friday. The point is to ship thin vertical slices and learn fast.

      **Celebration**: After demos, we have a [beefsteak-style](https://archive.is/S3LjP) standing barbecue (no pre-arranged seating) that invites relaxed, free-flowing conversation. Friends and family are invited to join, creating a bridge between the private program and the broader community.

      **Impact**: Demo Day serves as a public ledger of progress. Six Fridays equal six checkpoints, creating proof-of-work encoded in weekly commits that prospective participants can review.

    title: 'The Captains'
    content: |
      Each week has a dedicated captain who steers the ship through that week's journey, ensuring organic emergence rather than top-down direction.

      **Captain Responsibilities**:
      Shepherd the walks by setting the conversational pace, choosing wide paths, and ensuring group mixing. Time-box Friday demos, keep Monday orientations on track, organize Wednesday workshops and find time slots, and arrange rooms appropriately for different activities (talks, workshops, demos).

      **The Rotation**: By rotating leadership every week, the cohort practices the very autonomy it preaches. Leadership is shared, logistics are decentralized, and the program stays tight without feeling top-down.

      **The Exception**: Week 4 is designated as "time off" because the program is quite intense. We learned over time that we need this break.

    content: |
      Madeira isn't just beautiful—it's a **Bitcoin-friendly proving ground**. Thanks to the efforts of André and FREE Madeira, there are [150+ merchants](https://btcmap.org/community/free-madeira/merchants) accepting Bitcoin. Paying in sats is normal.

      **Off the Record, In Person**: We combine high-bandwidth in-person time with a private, off-the-record space. That safety lets wild ideas breathe before they ship to the open sea.

      **Alpha-Testing the Future**: Build a wallet on Thursday, pay with it on Friday. Hardware, merchants, and curious peers live within walking distance, collapsing the feedback loop.

      **The Filter and the Place**: You have to fly here and commit for six weeks—a natural filter. The volcanic island, subtropical climate, and dramatic topography create the space for fresh perspectives and new ideas to emerge.

    title: 'Who Should Apply?'
    content: |
      We're looking for **21 value-aligned builders** who want to see more real things built. There are no formal requirements—just alignment and a bias to build.

      **The Ideal Participant**:
      The ideal participant is an experienced builder who resonates with the Bitcoin ethos, can code independently, and is eager to explore the frontier. They are excited—rather than terrified—by the prospect of demoing half-baked prototypes, crave long, oxytocin-fueled walks, and thrive on rapid feedback. They believe that Freedom Tech is the moral imperative of our time, want to build the future they want to see, and are willing to be fully present for the full program.

      **The Magic Formula**: Bring 21 aligned people together in a place that is highly Bitcoin-friendly and beautiful, and you get the perspective shift needed for new ideas to take root.

      **The Goal**: We want to see awesome stuff being built, expand the impact that freedom tech can have, come up with new ideas and protocols, test them immediately, and have a good time while doing it.
