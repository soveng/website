      The week acts as a metronome for creativity. Friday's *Show* sets a hard deadline that concentrates effort—every participant demos something they wrote or prompted into existence themselves. The moment code compiles on stage it becomes shared reality. Over the weekend and during Monday's orientation the cohort *Talks*—walking Madeira's levadas, swapping critiques, and letting distributed cognition surface better approaches. From Tuesday onward everyone *Builds* toward the next demo.

      This relentless rhythm prevents perfectionism paralysis and creates the conditions for collaboration. Every week follows the same structure, creating a predictable cadence that lets participants focus on what matters: building and shipping real projects.
